OpenQuick
---------

OpenQuick is an open source framework for Rapid Application Development (RAD) of 2D games and apps.

It provides high-level Lua APIs on top of the following components:
- Cocos2d-x
- Box2D
- sqlite3 (luasqlite.luaforge.net)
- json (json.luaforge.net)

OpenQuick uses the version of Box2D contained within the Cocos2d-x distribution. It also uses the versions of Lua (5.2) and tolua++ contained with the Cocos2d-x distribution. At the time of writing, OpenQuick is tested against Cocos2d-x cocos2d-2.0-x-2.0.4 (Nov 2012).

If you are using OpenQuick WITH Marmalade Quick, then the runtime OS abstraction you are using will be Marmalade's - i.e. you are using the Marmalade back-end for Cocos2d-x (proj.marmalade) - you are NOT using any of the other Coco2d-x back-ends.

If you are using OpenQuick WITHOUT Marmalade Quick, then the runtime OS abstraction you are using will be Cocos2d-x's - i.e. you are using the Cocos2d-x platform back-ends, such as proj.win32, proj.ios etc.
