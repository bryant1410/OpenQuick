/**
A joint between two QNodes provided with physics.
This Class is a wrapper of all of the Box2D joint types and exposes their functions to Lua.
Most of the properties are directly exposed to LUA and are synchronized to the underlying Box2D layer
through the "_sync" method, which provides the synchronization for the read only properties as well.
Other properties are exposed through methods. 
Readonly properties cause an assertion failure when attempting to write to them.
Each created Joint instance is stored, as a pointer, in a double linked list owned by the global physics 
singleton, which add and removes item on Joints creation and destruction.
The physics global singleton calls the sinchronization method (_sync) for each Joints on update.
Joints can be destroyed also when their attached bodies are destroyed. This is managed 
through the Box2D joint userdata variable that stores a reference to the Joint that created it.
On body destruction Box2D triggers the destructor of all of the attached joints (Box2D joints), and physics
global singleton destroys all the wrapping Joints.
To create a specific joint type use the corresponding specialized method (e.g. _createBox2DRevoluteJoint).
Supported joint types: distance, friction, gear, pivot (revolute), piston (prismatic), pulley,
touch (mouse), wheel, weld, rope.
