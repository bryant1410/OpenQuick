/**
The 'ease' namespace is used for functions that can modify how tweens are applied.
Each easing function is of the form y = f(x), where x = (0..1) and y = (0..1).
Each easing function also takes a 'value' parameter which can be used to modify the easing function;
for example, to specify a multiplication factor or exponential power.
